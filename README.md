# Interactive Image Processing App

## Overview

This Streamlit-based application demonstrates various digital image processing techniques in an interactive and user-friendly interface. 

## Features

The app offers four main image processing functionalities:

1. **Image Formation Model**: Simulate illumination effects on images.
2. **Image Quantization**: Reduce the number of bits used to represent each pixel.
3. **Image Downsampling**: Decrease image resolution by a specified factor.
4. **Image Cropping**: Select a specific region of interest from the image.

## Key Highlights

- **Real-time Processing**: All operations update the image in real-time as users adjust parameters.
- **Interactive UI**: Utilizes Streamlit's widgets for an intuitive user experience.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Implements optimized image processing techniques using NumPy and OpenCV.
